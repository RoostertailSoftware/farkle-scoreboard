# Rules 
## and those that can be configured

1. Farkle (herein called `the game`) must be played with six (6) six-sided die with 1-2-3-4-5-6 on it faces
2. The game can be played with 1 to many players.  6 players seems to be the best and less boring than with more.
3. The 1-die is worth 100 points by itself
4. the 5-die is worth 50 points by iteself.
5. Multiples of 3 for any die count as 100 * the face value
6. A payer's turn consists of 1 or more rolls.
6. a player's turn can continue as long as the player rolls valid scoring die.  A valid roll is getting either:
    * 1-die
    * 5-die
    * double-tripples of any die
    * triples, quadruples, sextuples or setpuples on any die
7. a roll that is not valid ends the turn for that player and all points for that turn are lost.
8. A player can stop the turn at any time before a roll.
9. as a player chooses valid die to gain points they are not used again until all 6 die are validly used.
    * for example:  A player rolls 6 die and produces the following 1-1-2-3-4-5.  The player can choose the valid die of 1-1-5 for 250 points or just the 1's for 200 or any combination.  The player chooses to use only the 1s and recieves 200 points and has 4 die available for another roll.
